  /** EXERCISE 6.11
    *
    * To gain experience with the use of State, implement a finite state automaton
    * that models a simple candy dispenser. The machine has two types of input: you can
    * insert a coin, or you can turn the knob to dispense candy. It can be in one of two
    * states: locked or unlocked. It also tracks how many candies are left and how many
    * coins it contains.
    *
    * The rules of the machine are as follows:
    *   - Inserting a coin into a locked machine will cause it to unlock if there’s any
    *     candy left.
    *   - Turning the knob on an unlocked machine will cause it to dispense candy and
    *     become locked.
    *   - Turning the knob on a locked machine or inserting a coin into an unlocked
    *     machine does nothing.
    *   - A machine that’s out of candy ignores all inputs.
    *
    * The method simulateMachine should operate the machine based on the list of inputs
    * and return the number of coins and candies left in the machine at the end. For example,
    * if the input Machine has 10 coins and 5 candies, and a total of 4 candies are successfully
    * bought, the output should be (14, 1).
